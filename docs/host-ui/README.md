# GInfer host UI

## Offline status — accepted October 1, 2026

Replace the paired host's raw snapshot connection error and red alert with the
existing muted header status, labeled **GInfer offline**. Retain saved model/GPU
inventory and disabled offline mutation controls. Connected launch/inventory
errors remain actionable; transport/discovery/pairing behavior is unchanged.
The owning repository is `/ai/gchat`; network/storage authorities are
[host setup](../lan-host-setup.md) and [model management](../model-management.md).

Acceptance: the host card shows the muted status without the raw TCP message,
still offers cached inventory and blocks loading while offline; focused rendered
verification and full `make verify` pass. Commit/push and refresh the local Windows
app using its accepted engine/profile set. No engine changes or new error taxonomy.

| Owner / host | Exact path / revision | Purpose / status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GChat | `/ai/gchat`; reviewed source `d3199048d`, baseline `c4c170061` | Integrate the accepted candidate; final status in the handoff receipt |
| Offline host status | `/ai/gchat-worktrees/offline-host-status`, `fix/offline-host-status` | Reviewed candidate; release after integration and evidence retention |
| Offline host status | `/ai/gchat/out/offline-host-status-20261001/` | Retain verification, installer/update and cleanup evidence |
| Windows / RON-9950X3D2 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/GChat/gchat.exe`, source `d3199048d` | Installed, verified and open |
| Windows build / RON-9950X3D2 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/GChat/windows-build/offline-host-status-20261001` | Completed receipts retained; task directory removed |
| Accepted caches | `/ai/gchat/src-tauri/target`, native `%LOCALAPPDATA%/GChat/windows-build/source` | Reuse compiler/dependency caches |

The host-level alert is removed; the existing muted status now says GInfer offline.
The rendered offline-inventory regression passes, retaining cached selection and
blocked loading. Full `make verify` passed: 2,031 frontend tests (6 skipped), 15 extension tests,
critical coverage floors and supported Rust suites, including 529 desktop tests
(7 ignored). The 12 focused host-page tests pass. Coordinator review confirms
the existing offline gates and cached inventory are unchanged.

Recovery verified RON-9950X3D2 and RTX 5090 UUID
`GPU-92a61cb1-6b5e-cc7b-b669-72b2662d9d6e`. NSIS/MSI assembly and the authorized
update exited 0. The installed desktop matches the build except Tauri's three-byte
NSIS tag; CLI and host match their payloads. Both 120-file runtimes remain on engine
`74780ea1415ac8d3bb440d58442ac4f81a5dfde3`; all 103 profiles are unchanged. Four
model files, eight conversations, nine saved runs and agent definitions are preserved.
Visible desktop PID 40660 / host PID 37580 and local HTTPS identity pass startup checks.
The first startup check found a closed desktop; its log records a normal window-close
and exit request. Reopening once and checking the visible window resolved acceptance.

Retain both Windows installers and adjacent checksums in `out/windows/`.
The native task is removed; accepted compiler/dependency caches remain. Candidate
retirement and merge/push status are recorded in `out/offline-host-status-20261001/handoff.json`.
Next interactive check: the paired offline host card in the updated Windows app.
