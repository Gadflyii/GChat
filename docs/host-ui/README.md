# GInfer host UI

## Offline status — current work

Replace the paired host's raw snapshot connection error and red alert with the
existing muted header status, labeled **GInfer offline**. Retain saved model/GPU
inventory and disabled offline mutation controls. Connected launch/inventory
errors remain actionable; transport/discovery/pairing behavior is unchanged.
The owning repository is `/ai/gchat`; network/storage authorities are
[host setup](../lan-host-setup.md) and [model management](../model-management.md).

Acceptance: the host card shows the muted status without the raw TCP message,
still offers cached inventory and blocks loading while offline; focused rendered
verification and full `make verify` pass. Commit/push and refresh the local Windows
app using its accepted engine/profile set. No engine changes or new error taxonomy.

| Owner / host | Exact path / revision | Purpose / status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GChat | `/ai/gchat`, `c4c170061` | Clean accepted main baseline; Windows source `a5d2e35f7` |
| Offline host status | `/ai/gchat-worktrees/offline-host-status`, `fix/offline-host-status` | Owned candidate |
| Offline host status | Candidate `out/offline-host-status-20261001/` | Verification and installer/update evidence |
| Accepted caches | `/ai/gchat/src-tauri/target`, native `%LOCALAPPDATA%/GChat/windows-build/source` | Reuse compiler/dependency caches |

The host-level alert is removed; the existing muted status now says GInfer offline.
The rendered offline-inventory regression passes, retaining cached selection and
blocked loading. Full `make verify` passed: 2,031 frontend tests (6 skipped), 15 extension tests,
critical coverage floors and supported Rust suites, including 529 desktop tests
(7 ignored). The 12 focused host-page tests pass. Coordinator review confirms
the existing offline gates and cached inventory are unchanged.

Recovery verified RON-9950X3D2 and RTX 5090 UUID
`GPU-92a61cb1-6b5e-cc7b-b669-72b2662d9d6e`; app PID 2900 / host 21120, no
model process. Next: commit the reviewed change, build/update Windows, verify
installation and retire owned outputs.
